# python-django-webapp-template
Enhanced python library to handle fully searchable columns with OR operator.
I extended the library to have the following advantages:
  -to be able to add search fields to each column and receive the data from the backend
  -fields from the related table get automatically determined
  -AND operator to filter the table by all search entries
